## Description

This was a project in the Udacity Front-End Web Development nanodegree program. Given a couple of JavaScript files, we had to build an interactive résumé containing distinct sections and use JQuery to embed a map.

Since submitting the project, I have anonymized some of the information on the page for privacy reasons.

### Features

- JSON objects representing the sections
- Embedded Google map with pins on all locations mentioned in the sections
- Bootstrap menu bar featuring:
    - Anchor links allowing you to jump to different points on the page 
    - Collapsibility, showing only an icon on small devices
- Smooth scrolling for the anchor links
- Floating “back to top” button

### Credits

With zero background in JavaScript and an inability to fully grasp the concepts taught in this course unit, I completed this project mainly by trawling the discussion forum. Many thanks to students who posted questions and everyone who answered them in the threads! I also adapted code provided by [Cotswold Photo](http://cotswoldphoto.co.uk/bootstrap-float-to-top-button/) and [HTML-Tuts](http://html-tuts.com/back-to-top-button-jquery/) to implement the floating button, and by [Sycha Web Resources](http://www.sycha.com/jquery-smooth-scrolling-internal-anchor-links) for smooth scrolling.
